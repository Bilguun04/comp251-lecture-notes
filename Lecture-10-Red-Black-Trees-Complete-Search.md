**Algorithmic Paradigms**
- General approaches to the construction of correct and efficient solutions to problems.
- Such methods are of interest because:
	- They provide templates suited to solving a broad range of diverse problems.
	- They can be translated into common control and data structures provided by most high-level languages.
	- The temporal and spatial requirements of the algorithms can be precisely analyzed.
- Although more than one technique may be applicable to a specific problem, it is often the case that an algorithm constructed by one approach is clearly superior to equivalent solutions built using alternative techniques.

**Complete Search**
- Also known as recursive backtracking or brute force. (Backtracking is a sort of refined brute force)
- It is a method for solving a problem by searching the entire search space to obtain the required solution.
	- The search space can be large but finite.
	- Does not exist an algorithm that uses a method other than exhaustive search.
		- Need for developing techniques of searching, with the hope if cutting down the search space to possibly a much smaller space. Backtracking can be described as an organized exhaustive search which often avoids searching all possibilities.
